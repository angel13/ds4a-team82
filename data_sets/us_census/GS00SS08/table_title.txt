<p><b>Key Table Information:</b></p>

<p>See Appendix B in the state-level tables files at: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/school-finances/data/tables.html for a description of state-specific reporting anomalies. Payments to other school systems are excluded from this table. Expenditures for adult education, community services, and other nonelementary-secondary programs are also excluded. Enrollments used to calculate per pupil amounts represent fall memberships collected by NCES on the CCD agency universe file - "Local Education Agency (School District) Universe Survey." Enrollments for state educational facilities, federal school systems, and charter schools whose charters are held by a nongovernmental entity have been excluded. Enrollments from the CCD agency universe file were subject to adjustment if the enrollments were inconsistent with the finances reported. Annual Survey of School System Finances statistics include the finances of charter schools whose charters are held directly by a government or a government agency. Charter schools whose charters are held by nongovernmental entities are deemed to be out of scope for the Annual Survey of School System Finances.</p>
