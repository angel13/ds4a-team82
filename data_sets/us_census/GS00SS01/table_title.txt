<p><b>Key Table Information:</b></p>

<p>This information represents financial data for public independent and dependent school systems. It includes state payments made on behalf of public school systems and excludes financial transactions of public nonschool entities. See Appendix B in the state-level tables files at: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/school-finances/data/tables.html for a description of state-specific reporting anomalies. Cash and security holdings of dependent school systems are excluded as these holdings cannot be separated from the assets of their parent governments. Expenditures for adult education, community services, and other nonelementary-secondary programs are included under "Current spending" but are excluded from the per pupil data displayed in Tables 8, 11, and 20. Annual Survey of School System Finances statistics include the finances of charter schools whose charters are held directly by a government or a government agency. Charter schools whose charters are held by nongovernmental entities are deemed to be out of scope for the Annual Survey of School System Finances.</p>
